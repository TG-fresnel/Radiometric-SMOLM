# Radiometric Single Molecule Orientation Localisation Microscopy Code Repository

In this repository the code i developed during my masters thesis at instut Fresnel is shared.
All coding was done entirely in python.

The file get_ROI.py shows how to extract the regions of interest (ROI) from an image of a dense sample

The file get_affine.py shows how to get the affine trasformations that connect the different channels from a smaple of fluorescent beads

The file beads_demo shows how to extract the intensity ratios from different channels for a example image of beads, this file can also be used for single fluorophores
